Our state of the art management tools ensure that your computers always have the latest Windows and Mac patches. We also automatically patch a wide variety of popular applications such as Microsoft Office. Protecting your system against viruses is like dealing with a moving target. Once an antivirus program knows how to block known malware, suddenly a new, unknown threat appears to potentially infect your workstations and servers. Protecting your systems is our specialty. Give our Managed Security team a call and we’ll ensure your data is secure in no time **BLOCK ALL MALWARE, BOTH KNOWN AND EMERGING**

+ Signature-based scanning – Extensive, signature-based threat detection works to block all known threats.

+ Heuristic checks – Protect against previously unknown threats using heuristic checks, which detect unrecognized viruses in a sandbox environment away from your business’s core systems.

+ Continuous, real-time monitoring – Ongoing scans of your system help detect programs that perform behaviors and actions commonly associated with malware exploits.

#### MINIMIZE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THREAT PREVENTION

+ Lightweight scans – By reducing the size of scans, system resources can maintain high performance levels.
+ More accurate scanning – Scans that are more precise will reduce the number of false positives.
+ Scheduling options – Schedule deep scans for off-hours so you don’t disrupt employees during important productive hours.
